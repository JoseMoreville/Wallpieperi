# üìù Roadmap

- Detect multiple monitors and create a wallpaper for each one (different instances)
- Improve image quality of the wallpaper
- To add an optional particle system
- To be able to reproduce background music on the wallpaper
- Cursor interaction
- To be able to detect wheter the user is using an app and stop the wallpaper to save resorces (like battery)
- To be able to launch the app at startup (Optionally)
- Make it laptop friendly (reduce battery drain and all of that)

<br>

<small>
All of those points are planned but can be changed or removed in the future. Depending on the time I can spend on the development of the project and the need of features.

Ideas are welcome, please if you have one leave it on discussion or make a PR with a change you want to add, if it's cool it's gonna be added on a future version!
