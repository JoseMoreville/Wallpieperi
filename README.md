<b style="font-size:20px">Status: <span style="color:#74B1AE">Alpha</span> </b>
<br>
<small style="font-size:0.65em">Alpha build is going to be released this saturday, however all the code will be available after I check everything is ok for an alpha release.
Expect bugs and not to be as sharp as other applications.</small>

# How to use

# Features

# Roadmap

- Detect multiple monitors and create a wallpaper for each one (different instances)
- Improve image quality of the wallpaper
- To add an optional particle system
- To be able to reproduce background music on the wallpaper
- Cursor interaction
- To be able to detect wheter the user is using an app and stop the wallpaper to save resorces (like battery)
- To be able to launch the app at startup (Optionally) <b style="color:FABB10">WIP</b> ðŸ”‹
- Make it laptop friendly (reduce battery drain and all of that) <b style="color:FABB10">WIP</b> ðŸ”‹

<br>

<small style="font-size:12px">
All of those points are planned but can be changed or removed in the future. Depending on the time I can spend on the development of the project and the need of features.

Ideas are welcome, please if you have one leave it on discussion or make a PR with a change you want to add, if it's cool it's gonna be added on a future version!
